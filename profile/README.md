</p>

ZERO is the identity layer for the new web. It empowers users to prove information from verifiable credentials through ZKPs(zero-knowledge proofs), as well as privately-held dynamic data via Web proofs (zkTLS). It enables a frictionless web3 experience for users as well as easy, seamless, compliant user data verification for developers.

###  OMID Wallet

</p>

OMID (omni-identity) wallet is an application that enables users interact with the ZERO Protocol. It gives them the ability to grant access to their provable (verifiable/dynamic) data, as well as permision the issuance of credentials. It serves as a way to provide users self-custody to their identities and let's them make the trust assumption for their data.

Yes, the distinguishing characteristics of our brand elements is the change in colour, hehe.

 * Entity: #ffffff
 * Protocol: #000000
