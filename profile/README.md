S3N is a decentralised self-sovereign identity solution that enables permissionless issuance, verifiable provenance, and trustless verification of credentials.

It integrates a trusted notaries AVS called Core, on EigenLayer as a secure replacement for signing credentials, thereby enabling an open ecosystem for secure identity without the explicit need for issuer permission.
